human,Main page,""" Slug "" is a song by Passengers, a side project of musician Brian Eno and rock band U2 (pictured) . It was released on 7 November 1995 on Passengers' sole release, the experimental album Original Soundtracks 1 . The song was almost left off the album before it was rediscovered later during the recording sessions. Though Eno made most of the creative decisions during the sessions, ""Slug"" was one of the few tracks that the members from U2 tried to craft themselves. Lyrically, it portrays a desolate soul with the confusion of romance and faith. U2 and Eno tried to create a visual suggestion from the music that was more important than the story within the lyrics. In ""Slug"", the instrumentation is intended as visual music representing the lights turning on in a city at night. The group primarily drew inspiration for the song from U2's experiences in Tokyo at the conclusion of their Zoo TV Tour in 1993. ""Slug"" has been praised as one of the best songs on the album by critics from various publications. ( Full article... )",,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

herbal,Main page,""" Slug "" is a song by Passengers, a side project of musician Brian Eno and rock band U2 (pictured) . It was released on 7 November 1995 on Passengers' sole release, the experimental album Original Soundtracks 1 . The song was almost left off the album before it was rediscovered later during the recording sessions. Though Eno made most of the creative decisions during the sessions, ""Slug"" was one of the few tracks that the members from U2 tried to craft themselves. Lyrically, it portrays a desolate soul with the confusion of romance and faith. U2 and Eno tried to create a visual suggestion from the music that was more important than the story within the lyrics. In ""Slug"", the instrumentation is intended as visual music representing the lights turning on in a city at night. The group primarily drew inspiration for the song from U2's experiences in Tokyo at the conclusion of their Zoo TV Tour in 1993. ""Slug"" has been praised as one of the best songs on the album by critics from various publications. ( Full article... )",,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

herbal,Phrenology,"Phrenology is a pseudoscience that involves the measurement of bumps on the skull to predict mental traits. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is based on the concept that the brain is the organ of the mind, and that certain brain areas have localized, specific functions or modules. [ 3 ] It was said that the brain was composed of different muscles, so those that were used more often were bigger, resulting in the different skull shapes. This provided reasoning for the common presence of bumps on the skull in different locations. The brain ""muscles"" not being used as frequently remained small and were therefore not present on the exterior of the skull. Although both of those ideas have a basis in reality, phrenology generalizes beyond empirical knowledge in a way that departs from science. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] The central phrenological notion that measuring the contour of the skull can predict personality traits is discredited by empirical research. [ 5 ] Developed by German physician Franz Joseph Gall in 1796, [ 6 ] the discipline was influential in the 19th century, especially from about 1810 until 1840.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, vitalism was discussed among biologists , between those belonging to the mechanistic school who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Vitalist biologists such as Johannes Reinke proposed testable hypotheses meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but their experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism in this sense to have been refuted by empirical evidence , and hence regard it either as a superseded scientific theory , [ 4 ] or as a pseudoscience since the mid-20th century.

Instead, they generally mediate ecological interactions , which may produce a selective advantage for the organism by increasing its survivability or fecundity . Specific secondary metabolites are often restricted to a narrow set of species within a phylogenetic group. Secondary metabolites often play an important role in plant defense against herbivory and other interspecies defenses. Humans use secondary metabolites as medicines, flavourings, pigments, and recreational drugs. [ 2 ]",,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_metabolite

herbal,Doctrine of signatures,"The doctrine of signatures , also known as the doctrine of correspondences, is a biomedicinal theory or psuedoscience. It states that herbs or animals have physical or behavioral traits that mirror the ailment it can successfully treat. [ 1 ] Theological justifications, such as that of botanist William Cole, were that God would want to show men what plants would be useful for. [ 2 ] The doctrine of signatures has a debated origin. [ 3 ] Many historians believe it begins with primitive thinking methods, while other historians believe it originated with Dioscorides and was popularized in the 16th and 17th centuries after Jakob Böhme coined the doctrine of signatures in his book The Signature of All Things .
